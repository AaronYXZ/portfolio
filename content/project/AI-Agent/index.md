title: AI-Powered Treanding News Analyzer
summary: This project builds an end-to-end automation system that tracks real-time trending topics from major Chinese platforms (Baidu & Weibo), analyzes them using a large language model (LLM) via the DeepSeek API, and generates actionable business reports. It can optionally dispatch these reports via email and stores them locally for long-term knowledge accumulation.
