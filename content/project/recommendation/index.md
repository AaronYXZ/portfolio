title: Local AI Assistant using Ollama and Deepseek

summary: DeepSeek PizzaBot is a locally hosted AI assistant that answers questions about a pizza restaurant based on real customer reviews. It uses the DeepSeek 14B language model via Ollama and performs intelligent retrieval of relevant review data with vector embeddings. Built with LangChain and Chroma, the agent runs entirely offline, making it ideal for privacy-conscious applications, prototyping, or customer service exploration in the food industry. No internet access is required once models are downloaded.
